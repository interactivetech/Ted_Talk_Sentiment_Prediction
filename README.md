# Ted Talk Sentiment Prediction
We are exploring several language models (LSTM, DOC2Vec, CNNTextClassifier) and see how it performs on text classification

We examine sentiment analysis on the Ted Talk dataset. 

The contributions of this paper are: 

(1) We conduct basic prior analysis of the dataset. 

(2) We experiment with different preprocessing techniques of the dataset like BoW, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec. 

(3) We establish the baseline score using the most frequent tag. 

(4) We compare the results of Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and CNN to find the best model. 

(5) We experiment with the using of more high level features than just transcripts.
